# Discount Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The discount is only applied if it is **20% or higher**. Otherwise, the original price is returned.

## ðŸ’¡ What This Program Does

- Prompts the user to enter:
  - The original price of an item
  - The discount percentage
- Uses a function called `calculate_discount()` to:
  - Check if the discount is 20% or more
  - Apply the discount if it qualifies
  - Return the original price if the discount is too low
- Prints the final price after calculation

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- Python functions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- User input with `input()`
- Basic arithmetic operations

## ðŸ§ª Example

```python
Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
The final price is: 75.0
